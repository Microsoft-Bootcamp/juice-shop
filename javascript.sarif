Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engines provided by many popular JavaScript platforms use backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```javascript\n\n\t\t\ttext.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/g, ''); // BAD\n\t\t\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`/^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$/g`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```javascript\n\n\t\t\t^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$ // BAD\n\t\t\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```javascript\n\n\t\t\ttext.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/g, ''); // BAD\n\t\t\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`/^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$/g`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```javascript\n\n\t\t\t^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$ // BAD\n\t\t\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n"

These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`).

            "markdown" : "# Database query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query (such as a SQL or NoSQL query) is built from user-provided data without sufficient sanitization, a malicious user may be able to run malicious database queries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nMost database connector libraries offer a way of safely embedding untrusted data into a query by means of query parameters or prepared statements.\n\nFor NoSQL queries, make use of an operator like MongoDB's `$eq` to ensure that untrusted data is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, assume the function `handler` is an HTTP request handler in a web application, whose parameter `req` contains the request object.\n\nThe handler constructs two copies of the same SQL query involving user input taken from the request object, once unsafely using string concatenation, and once safely using query parameters.\n\nIn the first case, the query string `query1` is built by directly concatenating a user-supplied request parameter with some string literals. The parameter may include quote characters, so this code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.\n\nIn the second case, the parameter is embedded into the query string `query2` using query parameters.

One particular example of this is HTML entity encoding, where HTML special characters are replaced by HTML character entities to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML markup. For example, the less-than character is encoded as `&lt;` and the double-quote character as `&quot;`. Other examples include backslash-escaping for including untrusted data in string literals and percent-encoding for URI components.\n\nThe reverse process of replacing escape sequences with the characters they represent is known as unescaping.\n\nNote that the escape characters themselves (such as ampersand in the case of HTML encoding) play a special role during escaping and unescaping: they are themselves escaped, but also form part of the escaped representations of other characters. Hence care must be taken to avoid double escaping and unescaping: when escaping, the escape character must be escaped first, when unescaping it has to be unescaped last.\n\nIf used in the context of sanitization, double unescaping may render the sanitization ineffective.

These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation. For URI encoding, you can use the standard `encodeURIComponent` and `decodeURIComponent` functions.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to always escape the escape character first, and unescape it last.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a pair of hand-written HTML encoding and decoding functions:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.encode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&/g, \"&amp;\")\n          .replace(/\"/g, \"&quot;\")\n          .replace(/'/g, \"&apos;\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports.decode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&amp;/g, \"&\")\n          .replace(/&quot;/g, \"\\\"\")\n          .replace(/&apos;/g, \"'\");\n};\n\n```\nThe encoding function correctly handles ampersand before the other characters. For example, the string `me & \"you\"` is encoded as `me &amp; &quot;you&quot;`, and the string `&quot;` is encoded as `&amp;quot;`.\n\nThe decoding function, however, incorrectly decodes `&amp;` into `&` before handling the other characters. So while it correctly decodes the first example above, it decodes the second example (`&amp;quot;`) to `\"` (a single double quote), which is not correct.\n\nInstead, the decoding function should decode the ampersand last:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.encode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&/g, \"&amp;\")\n          .replace(/\"/g, \"&quot;\")\n          .replace(/'/g, \"&apos;\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports.decode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&quot;/g, \"\\\"\")\n          .replace(/&apos;/g, \"'\")\n          .replace(/&amp;/g, \"&\");\n};\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [html-entities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-entities) package.\n* npm: [js-string-escape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-string-escape) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

This leaves the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting since an attacker can use a string like `\" onclick=\"alert(42)` to inject JavaScript code into the response.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require('express')();\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tlet id = req.params.id;\n\tid = id.replace(/<|>/g, \"\"); // BAD\n\tlet userHtml = `<div data-id=\"${id}\">${getUserName(id) || \"Unknown name\"}</div>`;\n\t// ...\n\tres.send(prefix + userHtml + suffix);\n});\n\n```\nSanitizing the user-controlled data for `\"` helps prevent the vulnerability:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require('express')();\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tlet id = req.params.id;\n\tid = id.replace(/<|>|&|\"/g, \"\"); // GOOD\n\tlet userHtml = `<div data-id=\"${id}\">${getUserName(id) || \"Unknown name\"}</div>`;\n\t// ...\n\tres.send(prefix + userHtml + suffix);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n"

As a consequence, anyone can impersonate the remote server, and receive the confidential information.\n\n\n```javascript\nlet https = require(\"https\");\n\nhttps.request(\n  {\n    hostname: \"secure.my-online-bank.com\",\n    port: 443,\n    method: \"POST\",\n    path: \"send-confidential-information\",\n    rejectUnauthorized: false // BAD\n  },\n  response => {\n    // ... communicate with secure.my-online-bank.com\n  }\n);\n\n```\nTo make the connection secure, the `rejectUnauthorized` option should have its default value, or be explicitly set to `true`.\n\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\n* Wikipedia: [Man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)\n* Node.js: [TLS (SSL)](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-297](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html).\n"

            "text" : "# CORS misconfiguration for credentials transfer\nA server can send the `\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\"` CORS header to control when a browser may send user credentials in Cross-Origin HTTP requests.\n\nWhen the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header is `\"true\"`, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must have a value different from `\"*\"` in order to make browsers accept the header. Therefore, to allow multiple origins for Cross-Origin requests with credentials, the server must dynamically compute the value of the `\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\"` header. Computing this header value from information in the request to the server can therefore potentially allow an attacker to control the origins that the browser sends credentials to.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header value is `\"true\"`, a dynamic computation of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must involve sanitization if it relies on user-controlled input.\n\nSince the `\"null\"` origin is easy to obtain for an attacker, it is never safe to use `\"null\"` as the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header value is `\"true\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the server allows the browser to send user credentials in a Cross-Origin request. The request header `origins` controls the allowed origins for such a Cross-Origin request.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar https = require('https'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = https.createServer(function(){});\n\nserver.on('request', function(req, res) {\n    let origin = url.parse(req.url, true).query.origin;\n     // BAD: attacker can choose the value of origin\n    res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", origin);\n    res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", true);\n\n    // ...\n});\n\n```\nThis is not secure, since an attacker can choose the value of the `origin` request header to make the browser send credentials to their own server. The use of a whitelist containing allowed origins for the Cross-Origin request fixes the issue:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar https = require('https'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = https.createServer(function(){});\n\nserver.on('request', function(req, res) {\n    let origin = url.parse(req.url, true).query.origin,\n        whitelist = {\n            \"https://example.com\": true,\n            \"https://subdomain.example.com\": true,\n            \"https://example.com:1337\": true\n        };\n\n    if (origin in whitelist) {\n        // GOOD: the origin is in the whitelist\n        res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", origin);\n        res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", true);\n    }\n\n    // ...\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [CORS, Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [CORS, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials).\n* PortSwigger: [Exploiting CORS Misconfigurations for Bitcoins and Bounties](http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/10/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for.html)\n* W3C: [CORS for developers, Advice for Resource Owners](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-cors-for-developers/#resources)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-346](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/346.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-639](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-942](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/942.html).\n",

Computing this header value from information in the request to the server can therefore potentially allow an attacker to control the origins that the browser sends credentials to.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header value is `\"true\"`, a dynamic computation of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must involve sanitization if it relies on user-controlled input.\n\nSince the `\"null\"` origin is easy to obtain for an attacker, it is never safe to use `\"null\"` as the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header value is `\"true\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the server allows the browser to send user credentials in a Cross-Origin request. The request header `origins` controls the allowed origins for such a Cross-Origin request.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar https = require('https'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = https.createServer(function(){});\n\nserver.on('request', function(req, res) {\n    let origin = url.parse(req.url, true).query.origin;\n     // BAD: attacker can choose the value of origin\n    res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", origin);\n    res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", true);\n\n    // ...\n});\n\n```\nThis is not secure, since an attacker can choose the value of the `origin` request header to make the browser send credentials to their own server. The use of a whitelist containing allowed origins for the Cross-Origin request fixes the issue:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar https = require('https'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = https.createServer(function(){});\n\nserver.on('request', function(req, res) {\n    let origin = url.parse(req.url, true).query.origin,\n        whitelist = {\n            \"https://example.com\": true,\n            \"https://subdomain.example.com\": true,\n            \"https://example.com:1337\": true\n        };\n\n    if (origin in whitelist) {\n        // GOOD: the origin is in the whitelist\n        res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", origin);\n        res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", true);\n    }\n\n    // ...\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [CORS, Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [CORS, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials).\n* PortSwigger: [Exploiting CORS Misconfigurations for Bitcoins and Bounties](http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/10/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for.html)\n* W3C: [CORS for developers, Advice for Resource Owners](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-cors-for-developers/#resources)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-346](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/346.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-639](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-942](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/942.html).\n"

Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, DoS attacks are still possible and out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe easiest way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable external entity handling when parsing untrusted data.

If that string is from an untrusted source, this code may be vulnerable to an XXE attack, since the parser is invoked with the `noent` option set to `true`:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  libxml = require(\"libxmljs\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc, { noent: true });\n});\n\n```\nTo guard against XXE attacks, the `noent` option should be omitted or set to `false`. This means that no entity expansion is undertaken at all, not even for standard internal entities such as `&amp;` or `&gt;`. If desired, these entities can be expanded in a separate step using utility functions provided by libraries such as [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#unescape), [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#unescape) or [he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he).\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  libxml = require(\"libxmljs\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [XML External Entity (XXE) Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).\n* Timothy Morgen: [XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks](https://research.nccgroup.com/2014/05/19/xml-schema-dtd-and-entity-attacks-a-compendium-of-known-techniques/).\n* Timur Yunusov, Alexey Osipov: [XML Out-Of-Band Data Retrieval](https://www.slideshare.net/qqlan/bh-ready-v4).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-827](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/827.html).\n",

But since the exception is uncaught in the context of an asynchronous callback invocation (`fs.access(...)`), the entire server will terminate instead.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\"),\n  fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nfunction save(rootDir, path, content) {\n  if (!isValidPath(rootDir, req.query.filePath)) {\n    throw new Error(`Invalid filePath: ${req.query.filePath}`); // BAD crashes the server\n  }\n  // write content to disk\n}\nexpress().post(\"/save\", (req, res) => {\n  fs.exists(rootDir, (exists) => {\n    if (!exists) {\n      console.error(`Server setup is corrupted, ${rootDir} does not exist!`);\n      res.status(500);\n      res.end();\n      return;\n    }\n    save(rootDir, req.query.path, req.body);\n    res.status(200);\n    res.end();\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo remedy this, the server can catch the exception explicitly with a `try/catch` block, and generate an appropriate error response instead:\n\n\n```javascript\n// ...\nexpress().post(\"/save\", (req, res) => {\n  fs.exists(rootDir, (exists) => {\n    // ...\n    try {\n      save(rootDir, req.query.path, req.body); // GOOD no uncaught exception\n      res.status(200);\n      res.end();\n    } catch (e) {\n      res.status(500);\n      res.end();\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n```\nAn alternative is to use an `async` and `await` for the asynchronous behavior, since the server will then print warning messages about uncaught exceptions instead of terminating, unless the server was started with the commandline option `--unhandled-rejections=strict`:\n\n\n```javascript\n// ...\nexpress().post(\"/save\", async (req, res) => {\n  if (!(await fs.promises.exists(rootDir))) {\n    console.error(`Server setup is corrupted, ${rootDir} does not exist!`);\n    res.status(500);\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  save(rootDir, req.query.path, req.body); // MAYBE BAD, depends on the commandline options\n  res.status(200);\n  res.end();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-248](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n"

However, if the method name is user-controlled, an attacker could choose a name that makes the application invoke an unexpected method, which may cause a runtime exception. If this exception is not handled, it could be used to mount a denial-of-service attack.\n\nFor example, there might not be a method of the given name, or the result of the lookup might not be a function. In either case the method call will throw a `TypeError` at runtime.\n\nAnother, more subtle example is where the result of the lookup is a standard library method from `Object.prototype`, which most objects have on their prototype chain. Examples of such methods include `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty` and `__defineSetter__`. If the method call passes the wrong number or kind of arguments to these methods, they will throw an exception.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is best to avoid dynamic method lookup involving user-controlled names altogether, for instance by using a `Map` instead of a plain object.\n\nIf the dynamic method lookup cannot be avoided, consider whitelisting permitted method names. At the very least, check that the method is an own property and not inherited from the prototype object. If the object on which the method is looked up contains properties that are not methods, you should additionally check that the result of the lookup is a function. Even if the object only contains methods, it is still a good idea to perform this check in case other properties are added to the object later on.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an HTTP request parameter `action` property is used to dynamically look up a function in the `actions` map, which is then invoked with the `payload` parameter as its argument.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  let action = actions[req.params.action];\n  // BAD: `action` may not be a function\n  res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n});\n\n```\nThe intention is to allow clients to invoke the `play` or `pause` method, but there is no check that `action` is actually the name of a method stored in `actions`. If, for example, `action` is `rewind`, `action` will be `undefined` and the call will result in a runtime error.\n\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to turn `actions` into a `Map` and using `Map.prototype.has` to check whether the method name is valid before looking it up.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = new Map();\nactions.put(\"play\", function play(data) {\n  // ...\n});\nactions.put(\"pause\", function pause(data) {\n  // ...\n});\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.has(req.params.action)) {\n    if (typeof actions.get(req.params.action) === 'function'){\n      let action = actions.get(req.params.action);\n    }\n    // GOOD: `action` is either the `play` or the `pause` function from above\n    res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n  } else {\n    res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nIf `actions` cannot be turned into a `Map`, a `hasOwnProperty` check should be added to validate the method name:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.hasOwnProperty(req.params.action)) {\n    let action = actions[req.params.action];\n    if (typeof action === 'function') {\n      // GOOD: `action` is an own method of `actions`\n      res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Denial of Service](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service).\n* MDN: [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).\n* MDN: [Object.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-754](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html).\n",

Again, a limit on the size will prevent the attack:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tif (size > 1024) {\n\t\tres.statusCode = 400;\n\t\tres.end(\"Bad request.\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tlet dogs = new Array(size).fill(\"dog\"); // GOOD\n\n\t// ... use the dogs\n});\n```\n\n## Example\nFinally, the following example lets a user choose a delay after which a function is executed:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar delay = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.delay);\n\n\tsetTimeout(f, delay); // BAD\n\n});\n\n```\nThis is problematic because a large delay essentially makes the application wait indefinitely before executing the function. Repeated registrations of such delays will therefore use up all of the memory in the application. A limit on the delay will prevent the attack:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar delay = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.delay);\n\n\tif (delay > 1000) {\n\t\tres.statusCode = 400;\n\t\tres.end(\"Bad request.\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tsetTimeout(f, delay); // GOOD\n\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html).\n"

For instance, the attacker can choose `\"internal.example.com/#\"` as the target, causing the URL used in the request to be `\"https://internal.example.com/#.example.com/data\"`.\n\nA request to `https://internal.example.com` may be problematic if that server is not meant to be directly accessible from the attacker's machine.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport http from 'http';\nimport url from 'url';\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    var target = url.parse(req.url, true).query.target;\n\n    // BAD: `target` is controlled by the attacker\n    http.get('https://' + target + \".example.com/data/\", res => {\n        // process request response ...\n    });\n\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to use the user input to select a known fixed string before performing the request:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport http from 'http';\nimport url from 'url';\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    var target = url.parse(req.url, true).query.target;\n\n    var subdomain;\n    if (target === 'EU') {\n        subdomain = \"europe\"\n    } else {\n        subdomain = \"world\"\n    }\n\n    // GOOD: `subdomain` is controlled by the server\n    http.get('https://' + subdomain + \".example.com/data/\", res => {\n        // process request response ...\n    });\n\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html).\n"

            "text" : "# Implicit operand conversion\nIn JavaScript, most operators can be applied to operands of arbitrary types; at runtime, the operands will be implicitly converted to the appropriate type. For instance, the expression `p in obj` checks whether the object `obj` contains a property whose name equals the string that `p` evaluates to. If `p` does not evaluate to a string or `o` does not evaluate to an object, implicit conversions are performed before the check is carried out.\n\nIn many cases, however, these implicit conversions result from a typo or a misunderstanding of operator precedence rules. Even if the conversions are intentional, relying on them makes the code hard to understand.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nInspect the expression carefully to check whether the operands have been mistyped, and correct them if this is the case.

            "markdown" : "# Implicit operand conversion\nIn JavaScript, most operators can be applied to operands of arbitrary types; at runtime, the operands will be implicitly converted to the appropriate type. For instance, the expression `p in obj` checks whether the object `obj` contains a property whose name equals the string that `p` evaluates to. If `p` does not evaluate to a string or `o` does not evaluate to an object, implicit conversions are performed before the check is carried out.\n\nIn many cases, however, these implicit conversions result from a typo or a misunderstanding of operator precedence rules. Even if the conversions are intentional, relying on them makes the code hard to understand.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nInspect the expression carefully to check whether the operands have been mistyped, and correct them if this is the case. If the conversions are intentional, consider replacing them by explicit conversions to clarify the meaning of the code.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following code intends to check whether object `obj` does not contain a property of the name stored in variable `member`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction invk(obj, member) {\n    if (!member in obj)\n        throw new Error(\"No such member: \" + member);\n    return obj[member]();\n}\n```\nHowever, this test is ineffective as written: the operator `!` binds more tightly than `in`, so it is applied first.

A common defensive code pattern is to guard against dereferencing the values `null` or `undefined`. However, if the situation that some defensive code guards against never can occur, then the defensive code serves no purpose and can safely be removed.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nExamine the surrounding code to determine if the defensive code is worth keeping despite providing no practical use. If it is no longer needed, remove it.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a `cleanupLater` function that asynchronously will perform a cleanup task after some delay. When the cleanup task completes, the function invokes the provided callback parameter `cb`. To prevent a crash by invoking `cb` when it has the value `undefined`, defensive code guards the invocation by checking if `cb` is truthy.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cleanupLater(delay, cb) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        cleanup();\n        if (cb) { // BAD: useless check, `cb` is always truthy\n            cb();\n        }\n    }, delay)\n}\n\ncleanupLater(1000, function(){console.log(\"Cleanup done\")});\n\n```\nHowever, the `cleanupLater` function is always invoked with a callback argument, so the defensive code condition always holds, and it is therefore not required. The function can therefore be simplified to:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cleanupLater(delay, cb) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        cleanupNow();\n        // GOOD: no need to guard the invocation\n        cb();\n    }, delay)\n}\n\ncleanupLater(function(){console.log(\"Cleanup done\")});\n\n```\nGuarding against the same situation multiple times is another example of defensive code that provides no practical use. The example below shows a function that assigns a value to a property of an object, where defensive code ensures that the assigned value is not `undefined` or `null`.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setSafeStringProp(o, prop, v) {\n    // BAD: `v == null` is useless\n    var safe = v == undefined || v == null? '': v;\n    o[prop] = safe;\n}\n\n```\nHowever, due to coercion rules, `v == undefined` holds for both the situation where `v` is`undefined` and the situation where `v` is`null`, so the `v == null` guard serves no purpose, and can be removed:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setSafeStringProp(o, prop, v) {\n    // GOOD: `v == undefined` handles both `undefined` and `null`\n    var safe = v == undefined?

In some cases, the type tag returned by `typeof` is not sufficiently precise, so you may have to use other type test functions.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following code snippet tries to determine whether `a` is an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof a === 'array')\n\tconsole.log(\"It's an array!\");\n```\nNote that `typeof` is not precise enough to distinguish arrays from other objects, since it returns the type tag `\"object\"` for both. ECMAScript 5-compatible platforms provide a library function `Array.isArray` that can be used instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nif (Array.isArray(a))\n\tconsole.log(\"It's an array!\");\n```\nOn older platforms, you can use the technique explained on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray#Compatibility).\n\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Array.isArray()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-570](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/570.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-571](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/571.html).\n"

If it is not actually meant to be invoked as a constructor, turn all constructor calls to it into normal function calls.

This means that `this` in the function body will refer to the global object, so the assignments to `x` and `y` will create global variables.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nThe easiest way to fix this is to rewrite the call on line 7 to use `new`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = new Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nAlternatively, if you absolutely have to make it possible to call `Point` both with and without `new`, you could insert a guard that intercepts calls without `new` as follows:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Point))\n    return new Point(x, y);\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nNow, if `Point` is invoked without `new`, its `this` object (which is the global object) is not an instance of `Point`, so the \"then\" branch of the `if` statement is executed, which re-invokes `Point` on the same arguments, but this time with `new`.\n\n\n## References\n* D.

Assigning to a property of a primitive value has, in general, no effect, while attempting to manipulate such a property using `Object.defineProperty` will result in a runtime error.\n\nThere is one exception: assigning to a property for which a setter has been defined on the corresponding prototype object (such as `Number.prototype` or `String.prototype`) will invoke the setter function.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCarefully examine the assignment in question.

            "markdown" : "# Assignment to property of primitive value\nIn JavaScript, primitive values such as numbers and strings are immutable. Assigning to a property of a primitive value has, in general, no effect, while attempting to manipulate such a property using `Object.defineProperty` will result in a runtime error.\n\nThere is one exception: assigning to a property for which a setter has been defined on the corresponding prototype object (such as `Number.prototype` or `String.prototype`) will invoke the setter function.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCarefully examine the assignment in question.

Alternatively:\n\n* Rename some local variables so that the placeholders do not give the impression of referencing those.\n* Avoid mixing JavaScript template literals with other template systems in the same file.\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the call to `log.error` will log the string \"`${id}`\", rather than the contents of the `id` variable.\n\n\n```javascript\nlog.info(`Connecting to ${id}`)\nlet connection = openConnection(id)\nif (!connection) {\n  log.error('Could not connect to ${id}')\n}\n\n```\nTo correct the error message, change the quotes to backticks:\n\n\n```javascript\nlog.info(`Connecting to ${id}`)\nlet connection = openConnection(id)\nif (!connection) {\n  log.error(`Could not connect to ${id}`)\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).\n"

After removing the element at index 0, the loop counter is incremented to 1, but the second \"`..`\" string has now been shifted down to index 0 and will therefore be skipped.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to decrement the loop counter after removing an element from the array:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction removePathTraversal(path) {\n  let parts = path.split('/');\n  for (let i = 0; i < parts.length; ++i) {\n    if (parts[i] === '..') {\n      parts.splice(i, 1);\n      --i; // adjust for array shift\n    }\n  }\n  return path.join('/');\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, use the `filter` method:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction removePathTraversal(path) {\n  return path.split('/').filter(part => part !== '..').join('/');\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MDN: [Array.prototype.splice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice).\n* MDN: [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).\n"

Instead of forwarding the command-line arguments to the process, examine the command-line arguments and then choose among hard-coded string literals.\n\nIf the applicable libraries or commands cannot be determined at compile time, then add code to verify that each forwarded command-line argument is properly escaped before using it.\n\nIf the forwarded command-line arguments are part of the arguments of the system command, prefer a library routine that handles the arguments as an array of strings rather than a single concatenated string. This prevents the unexpected evaluation of special characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following wrapper script example executes another JavaScript file in a child process and forwards some command-line arguments. This is problematic because the special characters in the command-line arguments may change the meaning of the child process invocation unexpectedly. For instance, if one of the command-line arguments is `\"dollar$separated$name\"`, then the child process will substitute the two environment variables `$separated` and `$name` before invoking `node`.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar cp = require(\"child_process\");\n\nconst args = process.argv.slice(2);\nconst script = path.join(__dirname, 'bin', 'main.js');\ncp.execSync(`node ${script} ${args.join(' ')}\"`); // BAD\n\n```\nIf another program uses `child_process.execFile` to invoke the above wrapper script with input from a remote user, then there may be a command-line injection vulnerability.

            "markdown" : "# Indirect uncontrolled command line\nForwarding command-line arguments to `child_process.exec` or some other library routine that executes a system command within a shell can change the meaning of the command unexpectedly due to unescaped special characters.\n\nWhen the forwarded command-line arguments come from a parent process that has not escaped the special characters in the arguments, then the parent process may indirectly be vulnerable to command-line injection since the special characters are evaluated unexpectedly.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf possible, use hard-coded string literals to specify the command to run or library to load. Instead of forwarding the command-line arguments to the process, examine the command-line arguments and then choose among hard-coded string literals.\n\nIf the applicable libraries or commands cannot be determined at compile time, then add code to verify that each forwarded command-line argument is properly escaped before using it.\n\nIf the forwarded command-line arguments are part of the arguments of the system command, prefer a library routine that handles the arguments as an array of strings rather than a single concatenated string. This prevents the unexpected evaluation of special characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following wrapper script example executes another JavaScript file in a child process and forwards some command-line arguments. This is problematic because the special characters in the command-line arguments may change the meaning of the child process invocation unexpectedly. For instance, if one of the command-line arguments is `\"dollar$separated$name\"`, then the child process will substitute the two environment variables `$separated` and `$name` before invoking `node`.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar cp = require(\"child_process\");\n\nconst args = process.argv.slice(2);\nconst script = path.join(__dirname, 'bin', 'main.js');\ncp.execSync(`node ${script} ${args.join(' ')}\"`); // BAD\n\n```\nIf another program uses `child_process.execFile` to invoke the above wrapper script with input from a remote user, then there may be a command-line injection vulnerability. This may be surprising, since a command-line invocation with `child_process.execFile` is generally considered safe. But in this case, the remote user input is simply forwarded to the problematic `process.exec` call in the wrapper script.\n\nTo guard against this, use an API that does not perform environment variable substitution, such as `child_process.execFile`:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar cp = require(\"child_process\");\n\nconst args = process.argv.slice(2);\nconst script = path.join(__dirname, 'bin', 'main.js');\ncp.execFileSync('node', [script].concat(args)); // GOOD\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Command Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-88](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html).\n"

For example, if the property access is used as part of a write, an attacker may overwrite vital properties of objects, such as `__proto__`. This attack is known as *prototype pollution attack* and may serve as a vehicle for denial-of-service attacks. A similar attack vector, is to replace the `toString` property of an object with a primitive. Whenever `toString` is then called on that object, either explicitly or implicitly as part of a type coercion, an exception will be raised.\n\nMoreover, if the name of an HTTP header is user-controlled, an attacker may exploit this to overwrite security-critical headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` or `Content-Security-Policy`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe most common case in which prototype pollution vulnerabilities arise is when JavaScript objects are used for implementing map data structures. This case should be avoided whenever possible by using the ECMAScript 2015 `Map` instead.

In this way, the attacker does not have access to built-in properties which do not start with the chosen character.\n\nWhen using user input as part of a header name, a sanitization step should be performed on the input to ensure that the name does not clash with existing header names such as `Content-Security-Policy`.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the dynamically computed property `prop` is accessed on `myObj` using a user-controlled value.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\nvar myObj = {}\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tvar prop = req.query.userControlled; // BAD\n\tmyObj[prop] = function() {};\n\tconsole.log(\"Request object \" + myObj);\n});\n```\nThis is not secure since an attacker may exploit this code to overwrite the property `__proto__` with an empty function. If this happens, the concatenation in the `console.log` argument will fail with a confusing message such as \"Function.prototype.toString is not generic\". If the application does not properly handle this error, this scenario may result in a serious denial-of-service attack. The fix is to prepend the user-controlled string with a marker character such as `$` which will prevent arbitrary property names from being overwritten.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\nvar myObj = {}\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tvar prop = \"$\" + req.query.userControlled; // GOOD\n\tmyObj[prop] = function() {};\n\tconsole.log(\"Request object \" + myObj);\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* Prototype pollution attacks: [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9287), [lodash](https://hackerone.com/reports/310443), [hoek](https://npmjs.com/advisories/566).\n* Penetration testing report: [ header name injection attack](http://seclists.org/pen-test/2009/Mar/67)\n* npm blog post: [ dangers of square bracket notation](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security/blob/3c7522ca1be800353513282867a1034c795d9eb4/docs/the-dangers-of-square-bracket-notation.md)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-250](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

If the code is benign, it should always be possible to rewrite it without relying on dynamically interpreting data as code, improving both clarity and safety.\n\n\n## Example\nAs an example of malicious code using this obfuscation technique, consider the following simplified version of a snippet of backdoor code that was discovered in a dependency of the popular `event-stream` npm package:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar r = require;\n\nfunction e(r) {\n  return Buffer.from(r, \"hex\").toString()\n}\n\n// BAD: hexadecimal constant decoded and interpreted as import path\nvar n = r(e(\"2e2f746573742f64617461\"));\n\n```\nWhile this shows only the first few lines of code, it already looks very suspicious since it takes a hard-coded string literal, hex-decodes it and then uses it as an import path. The only reason to do so is to hide the name of the file being imported.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Trojan Horse](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Trojan_Horse).\n* The npm Blog: [Details about the event-stream incident](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-506](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/506.html).\n"

A client-side forged request may perform an unwanted action affecting the victim's account, or may lead to cross-site scripting if the request response is handled in an unsafe way. This is different from CSRF (cross-site request forgery), and will usually bypass CSRF protections. This is usually less severe than SSRF (server-side request forgery), as it does not expose internal services.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nRestrict user inputs in the URL of an outgoing request, in particular:\n\n* Avoid user input in the hostname of the URL. Pick the hostname from an allow-list instead of constructing it directly from user input.\n* Take care when user input is part of the pathname of the URL. Restrict the input so that path traversal (\"`../`\") cannot be used to redirect the request to an unintended endpoint.\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request used to fetch the pre-rendered HTML body of a message. It is using the endpoint `/api/messages/ID`, which is believed to respond with a safe HTML string, to be embedded in the page:\n\n\n```javascript\nasync function loadMessage() {\n    const query = new URLSearchParams(location.search);\n    const url = '/api/messages/' + query.get('message_id');\n    const data = await (await fetch(url)).json();\n    document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = data.html;\n}\n\n```\nHowever, the format of the message ID is not checked, and an attacker can abuse this to alter the endpoint targeted by the request. If they can redirect it to an endpoint that returns an untrusted value, this leads to cross-site scripting.\n\nFor example, given the query string `message_id=../pastebin/123`, the request will end up targeting the `/api/pastebin` endpoint. Or if there is an open redirect on the login page, a query string like `message_id=../../login?redirect_url=https://evil.com` could give the attacker full control over the response as well.\n\nIn example below, the input has been restricted to a number so that the endpoint cannot be altered:\n\n\n```javascript\nasync function loadMessage() {\n    const query = new URLSearchParams(location.search);\n    const url = '/api/messages/' + Number(query.get('message_id'));\n    const data = await (await fetch(url)).json();\n    document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = data.html;\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Server-side request forgery](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n* OWASP: [Cross-site request forgery](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html).\n",
